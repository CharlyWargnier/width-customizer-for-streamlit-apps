# ðŸŽˆ Width customizer for Streamlit Apps

As of now, you can only change your Streamlit app's width from narrow (default) to wide. You can switch to a persistent wide mode by adding this code at the top of your ```streamlit_app.py``` file

```python
# Use the full page instead of a narrow central column
st.set_page_config(layout="wide")
```

-   Now, wouldn't it be nice to have custom widths and change on the fly?
-   Wouldn't it be nice to change your columns' width at a click of a button?

I've made an app for that! Check it out! ðŸŽˆ

Feedback and PR are appreciated! :)
