# ðŸŽˆ Width customizer for Streamlit Apps

As of now, you can only change your @streamlit app's width from narrow to wide.

A simple app to wrangle your CSV files in just a few clicks!

Wouldn't it be nice to have on-the-fly customisation for:

âœ“ your app width
âœ“ your columns' width
âœ“ at a click of a button!

I've made an app for that! Check it out! ðŸŽˆ

Feedback and PR are appreciated! :)
